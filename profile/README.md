# 🎛️ GraphScript (GS)

GraphScript (GS) is a general-purpose visual scripting language that represents logic and behavior through connected nodes forming a graph.

Instead of writing code line by line, users define scripts by visually linking components like conditions, actions, loops, and I/O elements. Each node represents a component, and connections between them define the execution flow.

## ✨ Key Highlights
- Visual over Textual: Build logic through flow-based design, not syntax-heavy code.
- Component-Based: Each node performs a function—input, condition, loop, or action.
- Executable Graphs: Graphs are not just diagrams—they run like real code.
- For All Users: Designed for programmers, designers, educators, and creative toolmakers.
