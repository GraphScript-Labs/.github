# 🎛️ GraphScript (GS)

GraphScript (GS) is a general-purpose visual scripting language that represents logic and behavior through connected nodes forming a graph.

Instead of writing code line by line, users define scripts by visually linking components like conditions, actions, loops, and I/O elements. Each node represents a component, and connections between them define the execution flow.

## ✨ Key Highlights
- Visual over Textual: Build logic through flow-based design, not syntax-heavy code.
- Component-Based: Each node performs a function—input, condition, loop, or action.
- Executable Graphs: Graphs are not just diagrams—they run like real code.
- For All Users: Designed for programmers, designers, educators, and creative toolmakers.

## 🧩 The Ecosystem

GraphScript is powered by multiple tools, working together:

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 🔧 graphscript-editor | Web-based GUI to create and edit graph-based scripts visually. |
| ⚙️ gsam-compiler | Compiler that parses and transforms GS scripts into executable graph  code. |
| 🖥️ gs-desktop-service | Cross-platform local runtime service to execute and manage GraphScript projects. |
